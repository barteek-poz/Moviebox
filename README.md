**MOVIEBOX** is an online service providing information about movie premieres, films, TV series, and titles available on streaming platforms. It also allows users to add their favorite titles to a watchlist. <br>
The entire project was created by me in Figma (https://shorturl.at/tR1LW), and then developed using React Router and Tailwind. Information on the website is fetched from the TMDB database (https://www.themoviedb.org/). <br> <br>

**MAIN PAGE** <br>
The website is divided into five sections - home, movies, tv shows, streaming, and watchlist. Each section contains information about current premieres, most popular titles, or highest-rated movies and series.

**RANDOM TITLE GENERATOR** <br>
The streaming section only includes information about titles available on streaming platforms. Additionally, it features a special form that allows undecided users to randomly select a movie or TV series to watch.

**DYNAMIC SEARCH** <br>
In the navigation, there is an input field that allows for dynamic searching of movies and TV series.

If the title we are looking for does not appear, we can press Enter to navigate to the page with results matching the entered phrase (for example "Dune").

**TITLE DETAILS** <br>
Each title has its own subpage where we can find detailed information about the creators, cast, plot, and on which streaming platforms we can watch the selected title.

**WATCHLIST** <br>
Users can add their favorite titles to a watchlist, which stores this data in localStorage (eventually, the titles will be stored on the backend). Additionally, titles can be filtered by movies, series, or all titles together.

The entire project is responsive and works on devices with a screen width starting from 375 px.
